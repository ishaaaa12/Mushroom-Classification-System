üçÑ BINARY CLASSIFICATION WEB APP

This Streamlit-based web application allows users to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous using three machine learning algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Random Forest. The app provides an intuitive interface for selecting hyperparameters, evaluating model performance, and visualizing metrics such as the Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, and Precision-Recall Curve.

DATASET

The app uses the Mushroom Classification Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains descriptions of gilled mushrooms belonging to 23 species, classified as edible or poisonous. The dataset has categorical features, which are encoded for model training.

FEATURES

Multiple Classifiers: Choose between SVM, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Adjust model hyperparameters using an interactive sidebar.

Model Evaluation Metrics:Confusion Matrix,
                         ROC Curve,
                         Precision-Recall Curve

View Raw Data: Option to display the original mushroom dataset used for classification.
